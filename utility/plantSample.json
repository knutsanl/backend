All orchids are perennial herbs and grow in two specific patterns; Monopodial, where the stem grows from a single bud and leaves are added from the apex each year; and Sympodial, which means shoots emerge adjacent to each other on the stem, bloom and then stop growing, only to then be replaced by the next set"
